    "output": "Primary Target: Fire cluster at (19, 16)\n\nAction Sequence:\n1. Navigate to primary fire location\n2. Establish defensive perimeter around structures\n3. Apply concentrated water drops\n4. Monitor for spot fires and re-ignition\n5. Continue patrol\n\nResource Allocation:\n- Water usage: Aggressive (80-100%)\n- Energy management: High intensity flight\n- Flight pattern: Direct approach\n\nContingency Measures:\n- If fire spreads beyond control: Call for additional resources\n- If water runs low: Prioritize structure protection\n- If weather deteriorates: Consider retreat to safe distance",
